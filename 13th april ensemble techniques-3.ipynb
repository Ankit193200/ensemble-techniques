    "### Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest Regressor** is an ensemble learning method for regression that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the average prediction of the individual trees for regression problems. It is an extension of the Random Forest algorithm, which is also used for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through the following mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bagging:** It builds multiple decision trees on different random subsets of the training data. This diversity helps prevent overfitting to the peculiarities of the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Randomization:** At each node of the decision tree, only a random subset of features is considered for splitting. This reduces the likelihood of individual trees memorizing noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Averaging Predictions:** The final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of all the individual trees. This ensemble averaging helps in smoothing out overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor aggregates predictions through averaging. Each decision tree in the ensemble independently makes a prediction, and the final prediction for a given input is the average of the predictions across all the trees. This ensemble averaging is performed to obtain a more robust and generalizable prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What are the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor has several hyperparameters, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **n_estimators:** The number of trees in the forest.\n",
    "2. **max_depth:** The maximum depth of the trees.\n",
    "3. **min_samples_split:** The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\n",
    "4. **min_samples_leaf:** The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\n",
    "5. **max_features:** The number of features to consider when looking for the best split.\n",
    "6. **bootstrap:** Whether to bootstrap samples or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "These hyperparameters can be tuned to optimize the performance of the Random Forest Regressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest Regressor:**\n",
    "- Ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees during training.\n",
    "- Reduces overfitting through bagging and feature randomization.\n",
    "- Aggregates predictions by averaging (for regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Tree Regressor:**\n",
    "- A single decision tree that is prone to overfitting, especially in high-dimensional data.\n",
    "- Makes predictions based on the majority target variable within each leaf node.\n",
    "- Limited by the structure of a single tree and may capture noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Reduced Overfitting:** Through ensemble techniques and averaging.\n",
    "- **High Accuracy:** Often provides high accuracy and generalization.\n",
    "- **Handles Nonlinear Relationships:** Can capture complex nonlinear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "- **Complexity:** The model can be computationally expensive and harder to interpret than individual decision trees.\n",
    "- **Training Time:** Training multiple trees can be time-consuming for large datasets.\n",
    "- **Bias in Feature Importance:** In the presence of correlated features, it might show bias in feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. What is the output of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of a Random Forest Regressor is a continuous value, as it is used for regression tasks. For each input, the model predicts a numerical value, and the final output is typically an average of these predictions across all the decision trees in the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. Can Random Forest Regressor be used for classification tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Random Forest can be used for both regression and classification tasks. When used for classification, it is known as **Random Forest Classifier**. In this case, the ensemble of decision trees makes predictions about the class labels, and the final output is determined by majority voting among the trees. The class with the most votes becomes the predicted class."
